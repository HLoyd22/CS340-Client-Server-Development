How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to 
connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the 
future?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I write my programs to hold all of the qualities. Writing programs to be maintable are the the most straight forward. This would mean to add functionality and keep that current for the program. This will make this modular and resuable for the future. This will help build on a prohram without having to go back and rewrite things. Readability means following a logical order in my code and making comments that are readable and can be easy for the readed to understand. Adaptibility is similar to maintainabilty, If the code is modular and I have it set so that each function does basically one thing, then that function can be adapted to another incoming or outgoing data type to adapt to what I need at a given moment. For the Python CRUD module, the advantages of this were that the module was easily extensible for the modules we used it in in the future. I could use this module in the future to interface with any other instance of MongoDB I may end up using.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your 
approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other 
client requests?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a computer scientist, I would approach a problem by looking at the desired outcome and first determing the tools I would neeed to get there. Then, I would build the most base level tools and then implement the code that runs all of them. This project was very different than other course as the OS and working in the command prompt with MongoDB is something that is very new to me. This is also the first time that I used databases in this way. It was great to see everything that I learned all come together and be interactive. I think that the CRUD module is something that I will take with me as this is something that I could absoultely use in the future.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Computer scientists serve to engineer and develop computer-based solutions to optimize or streamline processes in order to maximize efficiencies in our work. This 
matters because the work of computer scientists drive productivity and allow us to process data in a way not previously possible by leveraging the power of computers. My 
work on these types of projects would help companies to do their work better by providing them with more information about their business processes or streamlining their 
busniness workflows to maximize efficiency, and therefor profits.
